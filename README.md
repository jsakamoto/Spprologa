# Spprologa [![NuGet Package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Spprologa.CSProlog.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spprologa.CSProlog/)

## _"Build client web apps with Prolog."_

_**"Spprologa"**_ is the open source library to make a "**S**ingle **P**age **Prolog** **A**pplication" built on _"[Blazor](https://blazor.net/) WebAssembly"_ and _"[C#Prolog](https://github.com/jsakamoto/CSharpProlog)"_.

## Hosting model

All of the Prolog codes are **running inside of the Web browser**, not the server process.  
The Prolog codes are interpreted by the interpreter that runs on the Web browser's WebAssembly engine, **not transpiled to JavaScript**.

"Spprologa" apps can be hosted on any HTTP servers that can serve static contents at least, such as GitHub Pages, Firebase, Netlify, Azure Static Web, etc.

## Jump start

### Requirements

- .NET SDK v.5.0 or later. (see also: _["Download .NET"](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)_)
- Any OS platforms and versions those are supported by .NET v.5.0 or later, such as Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows.

### Install project template

Before starting the "Spprologa" app programming, I recommend installing the "Spprologa" project template by the following command:

```shell
$ dotnet new -i Spprologa.Templates::0.0.1-preview.4.0.0.0
```

### Create a new "Spprologa" app project , and run it.

Once the installation of the project template is complete, you can create a new "Spprologa" application project in the current folder by the `dotnet new` command.

```shell
$ dotnet new spprologa
```

After creating a new "Spprologa" application project, executing the following command starts building and running the app. And the application's URL will be opened by a default Web browser automatically.

```shell
$ dotnet watch run
```

### Publish the project

If you want to deploy the app to a Web server, execute the `dotnet publish` command like this:

```shell
$ dotnet publish -c:Release -o path/to/output
```

After executing the command above, all of the contents will be generated that are required to running the app in the `path/to/output/wwwroot` folder.

## Programming "Spprologa" application

### `*.razor.prolog` files in the project are consulted automatically.

```prolog
% /Pages/Foo.razor.prolog
%   This Prolog code file will be consulted only once
%   when the "Foo.razor" component is first rendering.

input(name, "").

bird("swallow", canfly).
bird("penguin", canswim).
canfly(Name) :- bird(Name, canfly).

classify(Name, "can fly") :- canfly(Name).
classify(Name, "is bird, but can't fly.") :- bird(Name, _).
classify(_, "isn't bird.").

check :-
	input(name, Name), classify(Name, Message),
	retractall(message(_, _)), asserta(message(Name, Message)).
```

### Bind result of a query to DOM contents.

Use **`@query("...")`** to retrieve a variable value inside a solution of a query which is specified as an argument, and render it as the HTML contents.

```html
<!-- /Pages/Foo.razor -->
...
<span>
  <!-- ðŸ‘‡ This code will render "swallow". -->
  @query("canfly(Name)")
</span>
```

### Bind input to a fact.

Use **`@fact("...")`** to two way bind to an `input` element. 

```html
<!-- /Pages/Foo.razor -->
...
<input @bind='@fact("input(name, {0})").as_string' />
```

If the user inputs the text "gopher" into the `input` element above, then all `input(name, _)` facts will be retracted, and instead the fact `input(name, "gopher")` will be asserted.

### Bind an action to a query.

Use **`@then("...")`** to make the query will be called when an event is fired.

```html
<!-- /Pages/Foo.razor -->
...
<button @onclick='@then("check")'>Check</button>
```

If the user clicks the button above, the query `check` will be called.

### List up facts.

Use the **`<Case>`** component to retrieve all solutions of a query and render values of each solution to HTML contents.

```html
<!-- /Pages/Foo.razor -->
...
<ul>
  <Case Query="bird(Name, Ability)">
    <li>@context["Name"] - @context["Ability"]</li>
  </Case>
<ul>
```

The above code will render to HTML as follow:

```html
<ul>
  <li>swallow - canflay</li>
  <li>penguin - cannotflay</li>
</ul>
```

### Aside

Currently, the "Spprologa" is dependent on "C#Prolog".  
But the "Spprologa" is implemented based on pluggable architecture, so it can be replaced by the other Prolog implementation easily.


## Important Notice

### This is NOT a stable project. 

This project is a ** "proof of concept" ** to create a single page web app using the "Prolog" programming language.

This project has been started by just only my interest that the "Prolog" can make a single page web app or not.  
Therefore, **this project may be abandoned** after I lose interest in it.

However, this project is distributed under the Mozilla Public License.

So anybody can **fork** and can **continue** this project freely anytime, and I will strongly welcome it.
